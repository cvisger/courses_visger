## Welcome to Biodiversity, Evolution and Ecology!
Throughout this course, we will explore the evolution and diversity of living organisms and how these organisms interact with one another and their environment. Class meetings include lecture, laboratory, and activity sessions. Lectures will familiarize you with selected principles and concepts of biodiversity, evolution, and ecology. During weekly laboratory sessions, you will conduct exercises associated with these concepts. Activity sessions will provide you an opportunity to read and interpret appropriate scientific literature, analyze data, and think critically.

By the end of this course, you should be able to:

* Identify properties common to all living organisms.
* Explain the biological/phylogenetic basis of evolution and natural selection
* Explain the importance of alleles and population genetics.
* Appreciate the diversity and complexity of major lineages of life on earth.
* Recognize the major lineages of life on earth and their major characteristics.
* Discuss the ecological interactions among living organisms.
* Explain major biogeochemical cycles.
* Describe basic population properties and their interactions within an ecosystem.
* Analyze the interactions of different trophic levels within ecosystems.
* Develop and test hypotheses using the scientific method.
* Use basic scientific tools, including microscopes, computers, calipers, etc.
* Interpret results and communicate them in the structure of scientific literature.

## Course Description:
Introduction to properties of life and cells leading to genetic and biological diversity. Survey of biological diversity emphasizing variation leading to natural selection; introduction to ecological concepts within an evolutionary framework; a survey of ecosystems and global climate change. Development of scientific skills will be emphasized. Designed for science majors.



## Grades:
The Lecture portion of your grade will be calculated as points earned from Homework, pop-quizzes, Team Activities, Unit Exams, and a Cumulative Final. Most of the material from which you will earn your grade, will be derived from lectures. However, I expect that you read and make a whole-hearted attempt to understand the reading assignments before lecture. I will provide lectures on Canvas. Printing the lectures is not a substitute for attending lecture, as I tend to provide limited notes on the slides themselves.
You will need to attend class to fill in the gaps. If you miss a lecture, it is your responsibility to acquire notes from a classmate.

### Homework:
Learnsmart homework assignments will be available weekly. These should take about an hour to complete and will combine your assigned reading with a combination of multiple choice, short answer, and an occasional video clip. You will have a week to submit them...YES, A WEEK!...BUT...**I strongly recommend that you start these early** -- you are still expected to read the relevant chapters **PRIOR** to lecture. Unless otherwise noted, they will be due Sunday Evening. I will not answer emails regarding homework, for any reason, after Fridays at 4:00p. Homework assignments will cover material discussed that week, with the exception of your study guides, which will cover the entire unit prior to each exam.

### Quizzes:
Approximately 10 pop-quizzes will be given at the discretion of the instructor and will cover any lecture material covered during a given week (or previous week) in addition to any currently- assigned reading for the lecture. Quizzes will occur prior to the lecture session in which they are given.

### Team Activities:
We will be doing several in-class activities and/or small quizzes throughout the semester. Activities will be posted on SacCT and should be printed and brought with you. Some activities will require you to complete a pre-activity reading or online assignment. Quizzes will be given at random or if people are not paying attention, leaving early, or not completing the readings. **Missed activities & quizzes cannot be made up**. 

### Unit Exams and Comprehensive Final:
During this course, you will have 2 unit exams and a comprehensive final. Exams will be a mix of multiple choice, true/false, and short answer/essay questions. For exams, you will need a 1) ScanTron (#882-E), 2) pencil, and 3) pen for written questions.  Although some questions will survey your direct knowledge of a topic, most of each exam will require that you synthesize answers based on a conceptual understanding. I strongly recommend that all answers on your exam be provided clearly, and in blue or black ink...NO PENCILS. Approximately one-third of the material on the comprehensive final will be from lectures in the final unit, with the other two-thirds from previously covered material. It will not be word for word, but questions may be similar in concept to those previously presented in prior exams.

### Grade Breakdown:
Your letter grade will reflect the points you earn in this course; I use a +/- system. At the end of the semester, a breaking point within each grade category below will be determined for +/- assignments. **There will be no exceptions to the grade you receive, as it will be the grade you have earned.**

A 90-100%

B 80-89.9%

C 70-79.9%

D 60-69.9%

F < 60%

### Attendance:
**Attendance is Mandatory!** Please attend regularly and be prepared for class. In-class activities can only be accomplished during lectures. If you are absent, it is your responsibility to obtain  notes (or announcements/changes) from a classmate. Contact me if you have a legitimate excuse for missing an assignment/quiz/exam _before it is due_. I will require documentation of the emergency within 24 hr of your return. _NOTE: Missing more than two lab/activity periods without a valid, authorized excuse will result in an F grade for the entire course._

### General Policies & Etiquette:
* **Late work:** Assignments will be due on dates specified by your instructor. Late assignments without a documented excuse WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED!
* **Laptops/Cell phones:** : I allow phones/laptops for note-taking as long as they do not disrupt others (visually or audibly). Put phones on SILENT & no social media, please. 
* **Recording audio/visual** : Do not record me without my consent. If you have a documented need for recording please come see me.
* **Lateness** : I understand that there may be a time or two when you have a good reason for arriving late. However, chronic lateness will not be tolerated and you may not be allowed to participate in the scheduled exercise.
* **Behavior** : I respect all of my students and expect the same. Please do not talk while your instructor or others are speaking, fiddle with devices, or be disruptive/distracting. 
* **If you have questions** : Please come see me during office hours! If you have short questions, email is acceptable. But I will not answer questions that can be answered by reading the syllabus. Also, because I receive dozens of emails a day, I may not get back to you very quickly. 


### Cheating:
**I have a zero-tolerance policy for cheating, and I expect you to know what cheating is.** If you need a refresher, refer to: http://www.csus.edu/umanual/student/STU-0100.htm. Penalties for cheating may include failing the course and having an academic-misconduct incident report filed with the Office of Student Conduct. Furthermore, you may be required to meet with the Department chair as well as the university’s Director of Student Conduct. Please keep in mind that I take cheating VERY seriously, as it can result in complete dismissal from Sacramento State.

### Accommodations for Students with Disabilities:
If you have a disability and require accommodations, please provide disability documentation to SSWD (Lassen Hall 1008, 916-278-6955). Please discuss your accommodation needs with me after class or during my office hours early in the semester.

### Tips for Success:
1) **Study.** It might help. Study with other students. Write practice questions and test each other, explaining processes to others helps
with retention! The time you spend studying of course, is not the same for everyone. However, you should average 2-3 hours for every hour of lecture. That’s a minimum of 6 hours per week!
2) **Do not be afraid to ask questions!** It is likely that others are wondering the same thing. Even I do not always know the answer, but I will find it out for you if I do not.
3) **If you have an issue with the material, please come see me.** Often, it is easier to explain processes or clarify concepts one on one when I can more easily determine exactly where the problem is.
4) **Study...Before class too!** If you make an attempt to read through the assigned chapters etc. prior to the lecture, IT WILL improve your ability to understand and retain the information. Further, you can identify specific material that is unclear so that you can focus extra hard on it during lecture.
5) **Take command of your learning.** I will do my best to help you understand the material but ultimately you’re responsible for own learning. Develop good organizational skills.  Use a scheduler to keep track of assignments/exams and plan ahead. Do not wait until the last minute to study for an exam or finish an assignment. Remember Murphy’s Law... 
6) **Relax.** I am not here to make the course difficult. I want you to succeed and enjoy biology as much as I do!
