## Welcome to Biodiversity, Evolution and Ecology!
Throughout this course, we will explore the evolution and diversity of living organisms and how these organisms interact with one another and their environment. Class meetings include lecture, laboratory, and activity sessions. Lectures will familiarize you with selected principles and concepts of biodiversity, evolution, and ecology. During weekly laboratory sessions, you will conduct exercises associated with these concepts. Activity sessions will provide you an opportunity to read and interpret appropriate scientific literature, analyze data, and think critically.

By the end of this course, you should be able to:

* Identify properties common to all living organisms.
* Explain the biological/phylogenetic basis of evolution and natural selection
* Explain the importance of alleles and population genetics.
* Appreciate the diversity and complexity of major lineages of life on earth.
* Recognize the major lineages of life on earth and their major characteristics.
* Discuss the ecological interactions among living organisms.
* Explain major biogeochemical cycles.
* Describe basic population properties and their interactions within an ecosystem.
* Analyze the interactions of different trophic levels within ecosystems.
* Develop and test hypotheses using the scientific method.
* Use basic scientific tools, including microscopes, computers, calipers, etc.
* Interpret results and communicate them in the structure of scientific literature.

## Course Description:
Introduction to properties of life and cells leading to genetic and biological diversity. Survey of biological diversity emphasizing variation leading to natural selection; introduction to ecological concepts within an evolutionary framework; a survey of ecosystems and global climate change. Development of scientific skills will be emphasized. Designed for science majors.



## Grades:
The Lecture portion of your grade will be calculated as points earned from Homework, pop-
Quizzes, Team Activities, Unit Exams, and a Cumulative Final. Most of the material from which you will earn your grade, will be derived from lectures. However, I expect that you read and make a whole-hearted attempt to understand the reading assignments before lecture. I will provide lectures on SacCT. Printing the lectures is not a substitute for attending lecture, as I tend to provide limited notes on the slides themselves.
You will need to attend class to fill in the gaps. Additionally, there will be in-class assignments and activities, which cannot be made up. If you miss a lecture, it is your responsibility to acquire notes from a classmate.

### Homework:
Learnsmart homework assignments will be available weekly, and generally will not be given on exam weeks. These should take about an hour to complete and will combine your assigned reading with a combination of multiple choice, short answer, and an occasional video clip. You will have a week to submit them...YES, A WEEK!...BUT...I strongly recommend that you start these early -- you are still expected to read the relevant chapters **PRIOR** to lecture. Unless otherwise noted, they will be due Sunday Evening. I will not answer emails regarding homework, for any reason, after Fridays at 4:00p. Homework assignments will cover material discussed that week, with the exception of your study guides, which will cover the entire unit prior to each exam.

### Quizzes:
Approximately 10 pop-quizzes will be given at the discretion of the instructor and will cover any lecture material covered during a given week (or previous week) in addition to any currently- assigned reading for the lecture. Quizzes will occur prior to the lecture session in which they are given.

### Team Activities:
During the semester, approximately 4 lecture sessions will consist of activities that you will complete as a 4-member team. These will be announced prior to the day they are intended and should allow you to apply some of the more important concepts to which you are introduced, into a short investigatory exercise.

### Unit Exams and Comprehensive Final:
During this course, you will have 2 unit exams and a comprehensive final. Exams will consist of multiple choice, short answer, and true/false questions. My exams are not straightforward. Although some questions will survey your direct knowledge of a topic, most of each exam will require that you synthesize answers based on a conceptual understanding. I strongly recommend that all answers on your exam be provided clearly, and in blue or black ink...NO PENCILS. Approximately one-third of the material on the comprehensive final will be from lectures in the final unit, with the other two-thirds from previously covered material. It will not be word for word, but questions may be similar in concept to those previously presented in prior exams. No scantrons will be needed for any exam. Although we will go over exams in class, they will be returned to the instructor.

### Grade Breakdown:
Your letter grade will reflect the points you earn in this course; I use a +/- system. At the end of the semester, a breaking point within each grade category below will be determined for +/- assignments. **There will be no exceptions to the grade you receive, as it will be the grade you have earned.**

A 90-100%

B 80-89.9%

C 70-79.9%

D 60-69.9%

F < 60%

### Point Breakdown:

### Attendance:
**Attendance is Mandatory!** I take attendance and there will be NO make-up, in-class assignments. Therefore, if you miss a session, you will miss the material and lose any points associated with that exercise. If there is an excused absence, i.e. an emergency, death in the family, etc., please contact me as soon as possible afterward. Additionally, I will require documentation of the emergency within 24 hr of your return. _NOTE: Missing more than two lab/activity periods without a valid, authorized excuse will result in an F grade for the entire course._

### General Policies & Etiquette:
* **Late work:** Assignments will be due on dates specified by your instructor. Late
assignments without a documented excuse WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED!
* **Laptops/Cell phones:** These can be valuable tools for note-taking or photo-documentation purposes only. However, all cell phones otherwise must be turned off or put on vibrate. They will not be used for texting or social media during class. This privilege will be revoked if they are not used appropriately. Unless you have a documented reason, lectures shall not be recorded.
* **Lateness:** I understand that there may be a time or two when you have a good reason for arriving late. However, chronic lateness will not be tolerated and you may not be allowed to participate in the scheduled exercise.
* **Behavior:** Be respectful of your instructor and your fellow students. Avoid excessive talking while your instructor is speaking. Encourage and support each other, conduct yourself appropriately and professionally, and have a positive attitude. Disruptive or disrespectful behavior will not be tolerated.


### Cheating:
**I have a zero-tolerance policy for cheating, and I expect you to know what cheating is.** If you need a refresher, refer to: http://www.csus.edu/umanual/student/STU-0100.htm. Penalties for cheating may include failing the course and having an academic-misconduct incident report filed with the Office of Student Conduct. Furthermore, you may be required to meet with the Department chair as well as the university’s Director of Student Conduct. Please keep in mind that I take cheating VERY seriously, as it can result in complete dismissal from Sacramento State.

### Accommodations for Students with Disabilities:
If you have a disability and require accommodations, please provide disability documentation to SSWD (Lassen Hall 1008, 916-278-6955). Please discuss your accommodation needs with me after class or during my office hours early in the semester.

### Tips for Success:
1) **Study.** It might help. Study with other students. Explaining processes to others helps
with retention! The time you spend studying of course, is not the same for everyone. However, you should average 2-3 hours for every hour of lecture. That’s a minimum of 6 hours per week!
2) **Do not be afraid to ask questions!** It is likely that others are wondering the same thing. Even I do not always know the answer, but I will find it out for you if I do not.
3) **If you have an issue with the material, please come see me.** Often, it is easier to explain processes or clarify concepts one on one when I can more easily determine exactly where the problem is.
4) **Study...Before class too!** If you make an attempt to read through the assigned chapters etc. prior to the lecture, IT WILL improve your ability to understand and retain the information. Further, you can identify specific material that is unclear so that you can ask about it during lecture.
5) **Do not wait until the last night to study for an exam.** It will not work.
6) **Relax.** I am not here to make the course difficult. I want you to succeed!
